# Ledger

A place for scrivening goals and logs. A simple, RESTful server that exposes an API for [Scriven](https://github.com/jakofranko/scriven). Built using Node.js, Express, and SQLite.

## TODO

* Clean out unused libs and routes
* Add additional fields to Logs with descriptions and durations, and make sure that the goal_id is optional
* Goal-related milestones
* Security layer for user authentication and access
